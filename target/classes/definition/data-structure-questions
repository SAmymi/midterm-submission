Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.it provides efficiency, reusability and abstraction. it plays an important role in enhancing the performance
of a program because the main function of the program is to store and retrieve the user's data as fast as possible.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Create, Destroy, Traversal:- Accessing a particular data, Updation:-it updates or modifies the data.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
numerical analysis, operating system,A.I.;compiler design,database management, graphics, and statistical analysis.

what is an Array?
is a collection of similar data elements stored at contiguous memory location.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
an Array is a fixed-length data structure. ArrayList is a variable-length data structure.

what is LinkedList?
is an ordered collection that contains many objects of the same type.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. LinkedList is an ordered collection of elements of the same
type in which each element is connected to the next using pointers.

what is queue?
is a collection of items in which only the earliest added item may be accessed.

what is stack?
is a last in First out(LIFO)data structure. it supports two basic operations called push and pop.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO is an abbreviation for fist in first out, LIFO is an abbreviation for last in fist out is same as
fist in,last out.
what is the order of complexity?
complexity classes O(1),o(log n), O(n),O(n log n)

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
is O(1).

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
is O(log N).

what is tree in data structure?
is a hierarchical tree structure defined as a collection of nodes.

what is graph in data structure?
is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value.
HashMap is fast whereas Hashtable is slow.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
RDBMS=Array (i.e.Array of structures) Network data model= Graph.
hierarchical data model = trees.

How HashMap works in java?
uses multiple buckets and each bucket points to a Singly Linked list where the entries (nodes)are stored.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
occurs when we access an array, or a Collection, that is backed by an array with an invalid index.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
for loop and copy elements of one to another one by one.
use the clone method to clone an array
arraycopy() method of System class.

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
an array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. Linked list is an ordered collection of elements of the
same type in which each element is connected to the next using pointers.

What is DFS and BFS?
BFS stands for breadth first search, DFS stands for depth First Search.

What is Recursion?
a method that calls itself.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
in a linear data structure, data elements are arranged in a linear order where each and every element is attached
to its previous and next adjacent. data elements are attached in hierarchically manner.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends
towards a particular value or infinity.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?



Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
