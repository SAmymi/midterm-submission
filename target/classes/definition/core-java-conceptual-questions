A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state the the object
of its type support.

What is object?
objects have states and behaviors, its an instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
An application  entry point identifies a resource that is an access point
to an application.

Why main is static?
the main static so that JVM can invoke it without instantiating the class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Objects class which is stored in the java,lang package, is the ultimate superclass of all java classes.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
the difference is that path is set for java tools in java programs like java and javac,which are used to compile
your code, Classpath is used by System or Application class loader to locate and load compile java bytecodes store in
the class file.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
An abstract class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override.
An interface only allows you  to define functionality not implement it.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
you can not, but we can implement a subclass of abstract class.

Application programing interface, facebook,Google maps, Amazon,

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
java supports multiple inheritance through interface only. A class can implement any number of interfaces but can
extend only one class.Multiple inheritance not supported because it leads to deadly diamond problem.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
it occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.(parent,child).

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
is an event it occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions,
the try-catch to handle it.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
static keyword is used for memory management, used to share the same variables or method of a given class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
final keyword means that the value can't be modified in the future,we use it in a method declaration to indicate that
the method cannot be overridden bu subclasses.

What is final, finally and finalize?
Final is a keyword and is used as access modifier in Java. Finally is a block in Java used for Exception Handling.
Finalize is a method in Java used for Garbage Collection Application. Final in Java is used with variables, methods,
and access permission.

What is a constructor ?
A constructor in Java is similar to a method that is invoked when an object of the class is created.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A class can have multiple constructors that assign the fields in different ways.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
called the default constructor.
What is "this" keyword in java ?
"this" keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
its a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.

What is JVM stand for ?
Java Virtual Machine

Is JVM platform independent?
yes

What version of java are you using?
Java eclipse
What is JAR stand for ?
JAR stands for Java Archive.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
JDK is a software development kit whereas JRE is a software bundle that allows Java program to run, whereas JVM is an
environment for executing bytecode.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
JRE is an environment, in order to execute any Java program locally. JVM is where it's responsible for converting
the Bytecode into machine specific code and makes java program write-once-run-anywhere.

What is compile time and run time?
Compile time is the period when the programming code (Java,Python..) is converted to the machine code.Runtime is the
period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.

What is heap?
is a memory used by programming languages to store global variables.

How java manage it's memory?
Java used an automatic memory management system called a garbage collector.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String is immutable whereas StringBuffer is thread-safe and synchronized whereas StingBuilder is not.

What is Singleton class?
is a software design pattern that ensure that a class can only have one object.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.. Deserialization is the reverse
process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual java object in memory.

when to use transient variable in java?
used to indicate that a field should not be part of the serialization process.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
while loop checks the condition first and then execute the statements,whereas do while loop will execute the statements
at least once, then the condition is checked.

What is Enum?
an Enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants.

What is Iterator?
is an Object that can be used to loop through collection, like ArrayList and Hashset.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
int is a primitive data type and takes 32 bits(4bytes) to store. integer is an object takes 128(16bytes).

Why is String Immutable in Java?
because of the security, synchronization and concurrency,caching, and class loading.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
the process of invoking a sequence of constructor upon initialization of a class object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
serial garbage collector uses a single thread for garbage collection process while the Parallel garbage collector
uses multiple threads for the garbage collection.

What is JIT stands for?
Just-IN-Time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Java objects reside in an area called the heap. the Heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or
decrease in size while the application runs. when the heap becomes full, garbage is collected. During the garbage
collection objects that are no longer usd are cleared, thus making space for new objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
garbage collection does not guarantee that a program will not run out of memory.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
Java Heap Space is used throughout the application, but Stack is only used for the method- or methods -currently
running.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
reflection is a feature in the Java Programming language. it allows an executing Java program to examine or
to introspect upon itself, and manipulate internal properties of the program.

what is multithreading in java?
refers to a process of Executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum utilization of the CPU.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.
What is Framework?
is structure that you can build software on. it serves as a foundation, so you're not starting from scratch.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
Selenium,JUnit,Cucumber,TestNG

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
TestNG is a testing framework. JUnit is an open source framework used to trigger and write tests.

What are the dependencies for this project?
Finish to start.
what is dependency injection in java?
DI is the concept in which objects get other required objects from outside.
What is static binding and dynamic binding?
static binding happens when all information needed to call function is available at the compile time. Dynamic happens
when the compiler cannot determine all information needed for a function call at compile-time.
